\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}

The experiments were done on the \textit{Instrument segmentation and tracking}
dataset of the Endoscopic Vision Challenge
\enquote{EndoVis}\footnote{\href{http://endovis.grand-challenge.org/}{http://endovis.grand-challenge.org}}.
It contains photos of minimal-invasive operations. The dataset already contains
a training-test-split. The training data consists of four operations. Each
operation has 40~RGB~images in a resolution of $\SI{640}{\pixel} \times
\SI{480}{\pixel}$. The test set has 10~more images of those 4~operations as
well as 50~images for 2~more operations. This means, in total the training data
consist of $4 \cdot 40 = 160$ photos and the testing contains $4 \cdot 10 + 2
\cdot 50 = 140$ photos. As each pixel has to be classified as \textit{medical
instrument} or \textit{background}, there are
$140 \cdot 640 \cdot 480 = \num{43008000}$ classifications to be done for
testing.

A desktop computer with a Titan Black and an Intel Core i7-4930K was used for
evaluation.
