Distinguishing medical instruments from background is a basic task which
supplements many applications and further analysis. If this task works robust
and fast, one can use it for instance segmentation of medical instruments,
operation phase detection, pose estimation of the instruments, recognition of
the organs and ill tissue. This paper introduces basic ideas of semantic
segmentation with deep learning in the context of minimal-invasive operations.
A fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is applied to the EndoVis dataset.
