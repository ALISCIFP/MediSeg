Pixel-wise segmentation was successfully applied in other domains. For example,
\cite{bittel2015pixel} introduces a system which does pixel-wise segmentation
for autonomous cars of the classes \textit{street} and \textit{no street}. A
more detailed introduction to semantic segmentation can be found
in~\cite{thoma2016survey}.
