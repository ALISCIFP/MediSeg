\subsection{Local Models}\label{sec:ap4}

A slightly better model than the baseline used the coordinate of the pixel in
the image as well as $\SI{3}{\pixel}$ erosion and dilation. This is known as a
morphological opening. This model achieved an per-pixel accuracy of
$\SI{93.51}{\percent}$, a precision of $\SI{76.74}{\percent}$ and a recall of
$\SI{42.30}{\percent}$. The confusion matrix is given
in~\cref{table:cm-model-303}.

If only the opening operation was applied, then the model achieves only an accuracy
of $\SI{91.07}{\percent}$, a precision of $\SI{74.76}{\percent}$ and a recall
of $\SI{4.50}{\percent}$.\\
If the model with coordinates is used without morphological opening, then it
gets an accuracy of $\SI{93.42}{\percent}$, a precision of $\SI{76.98}{\percent}$
and a recall of $\SI{40.65}{\percent}$.

Astonishingly, the accuracy of models which made use of a tiny patch around the
pixel which was to classify decreased to about $\SI{92.11}{\percent}$, the
precision is $\SI{42.30}{\percent}$ and the recall is $\SI{76.74}{\percent}$.
The classification of one image took about $\SI{1.54}{\second}$.

TODO: This may not happen. The model could simply set the weights to 0 and thus
ignoring the other features. Where exactly is the problem?
